**Dependencies:**

This sofftware requires [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to build, test, run, etc. If you do not have these installed, please follow these instructions: `http://blog.npmjs.org/post/85484771375/how-to-install-npm`.

Also, you'll need [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/features.html) if you use the npm script to launch it. You can get it here: `https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html`


**Here are some fun things you can do with the game:**

- Run the tests: `npm run test`
- Play the game in the browser: `npm run browser`
- Play the game in the terminal: `npm run terminal`
- Run the tester script: `npm run tester`

**Software is never done**

If I had a little more time, I'd love to improve the browser experience by animating the game on an HTML5 canvas. I'd also add some controls to reset the game with alternate seed patterns.
